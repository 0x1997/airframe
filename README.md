Airframe is a dependency injection library tailored to Scala. While Google's [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) is designed for injecting Java objects (e.g., using constructors or providers), Airframe redesigned it for Scala traits so that we can mix-in traits that have many object dependencies. 

To use Airframe, you only need the following three steps:
- ***Bind***: Describe instance types necessary in your class with `bind[X]`: 
```scala
import wvlet.airframe._

trait App {
  val x = bind[X]
  val y = bind[Y]
  val z = bind[Z]
  // Do something with X, Y, and Z
}
```
- ***Design***: Describe how to provide object instances:
```scala
val design : Design = 
   newDesign
     .bind[X].toInstance(new X)  // Bind type X to a concrete instance
     .bind[Y].toSingleton        // Bind type Y to a singleton object
     .bind[Z].to[ZImpl]          // Bind type Z to an instance of ZImpl
```
*Design* is *immutable*, so you can safely reuse and extend it for creating new types of object design.

- ***Build***: Create a concrete instance:
```scala
val session = design.newSession
val app : App = session.build[App]
```

Airframe builds an instance of `App` by following the binding rules specified in the *Design* object.
`Session` is used for managing the lifecycle of objects generated by Airframe. For example, singleton objects are defined within a Session, and can be discarded with `Session.shutdown`.

The major advantages of Airframe are as follows:
- Simple to use. Just `import wvlet.airframe._` and do the above three steps. 
- *Design* remembers how to build complex objects on behalf of you.
  - For example, you can avoid code duplication in your test/production codes. Compare writing `new App(new X, new Y(...), new Z(...), ...)` every time and just calling `session.build[App]`.
  - When writing application codes, you only need to care about how to ***use*** objects, rather than how to ***provide*** them. *Design* already knows how to prepare objects.
- You can enjoy the flexibility of Scala traits and dependency injection (DI) at the same time.
  - Mixing traits is far easier than using constructors, since traits can be combined in an arbitrary order.

# Usage

**build.sbt** [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.wvlet/airframe_2.11/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.wvlet/airframe_2.11)
```
libraryDependencies += "org.wvlet" %% "airframe" % "(version)"
```

(The whole code used in this section can be found here [AirframeTest](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/blob/master/src/test/scala/wvlet/airframe/AirframeTest.scala))

You can inject an object with `bind` method in Airframe. Assume that we want to create a service that prints a greeting at random:

```scala
import wvlet.airframe._ 
import wvlet.log.LogSupport

trait Printer {
  def print(s: String): Unit
}

// Concrete classes which will be bound to Printer
class ConsolePrinter(config: ConsoleConfig) extends Printer { 
  def print(s: String) { println(s) }
}
class LogPrinter extends Printer with LogSupport { 
  def print(s: String) { info(s) }
}

class Fortune { 
  def generate: String = { /** generate random fortune message **/ }
}
```

## Local variable binding

Using local variables is the simplest way to binding objects:

```scala
trait FortunePrinterEmbedded {
  val printer = bind[Printer]
  val fortune = bind[Fortune]

  printer.print(fortune.generate)
}
```

## Reuse bindings with mixin

To reuse bindings, we can create XXXService traits and mix-in them to build a complex object. 

```scala
import wvlet.airframe._

trait PrinterService {
  val printer = bind[Printer] // It can bind any Printer types
}

trait FortuneService {
  val fortune = bind[Fortune]
}

trait FortunePrinterMixin extends PrinterService with FortuneService {
  printer.print(fortune.generate)
}
```

It is also possible to manually inject an instance implementation. This is useful for changing the behavior of objects for testing: 
```scala
trait CustomPrinterMixin extends FortunePrinterMixin {
  override val printer = new Printer { def print(s:String) = { Console.err.println(s) } } // Manually inject an instance
}
```

## Tagged binding

Airframe can provide separate implementations to the same type object by using object tagging (@@):
```scala
import wvlet.obj.tag.@@
case class Fruit(name: String)

trait Apple
trait Banana

trait TaggedBinding {
  val apple  = bind[Fruit @@ Apple]
  val banana = bind[Fruit @@ Banana]
}
 ```

Tagged binding is also useful to inject primitive type values:
```scala
trait Env

trait MyService {
  // Coditional binding
  lazy val threadManager = bind[String @@ Env] match {
     case "test" => bind[TestingThreadManager] // prepare a testing thread manager
     case "production" => bind[ThreadManager] // prepare a thread manager for production
  }
}

val coreDesign = newDesign
val testingDesign = coreDesign.bind[String @@ Env].toInstance("test")
val productionDesign = coreDesign.bind[String @@ Env].toInstance("production")
```

## Object Injection

Before binding objects, you need to define a `Design` of dependent components. It is similar to `modules` in Guice.

```scala
val design = newDesign
  .bind[Printer].to[ConsolePrinter]  // Airframe will generate an instance of ConsolePrinter by resolving its dependencies
  .bind[ConsoleConfig].toInstance(ConsoleConfig(System.err)) // Binding an actual instance
```

You can also define bindings to the tagged objects:

```scala
val design = newDesign
  .bind[Fruit @@ Apple].toInstance(Fruit("apple"))
  .bind[Fruit @@ Banana].toInstance(Fruit("banana"))
  .bind[Fruit @@ Lemon].toInstance(Fruit("lemon"))
````

To bind a class to a singleton, use `toSingleton`:

```scala
class HeavyObject extends LogSupport { /** */ }

val design = newDesign
  .bind[HeavyOBject].toSingleton
````

We can create an object from a design by using `newSession.build[X]`:

```
design.newSession.build[FortunePrinterMixin]
```

# Airframe Utilities

Airframe has several utilities that make easier your programming in Scala:
    
- [airframe-log](airframe-log.md) 
  - Light-weight handy logging library
- [airframe-config](config.md) 
  - Configuration reader & provider
- [airframe-metrics](airframe-metrics.html) 
  - Human-readable representation of time, time range, and data size.
- [airframe-jmx](airframe-jmx.md) 
  - Enable application monitoring through JMX
- [airframe-surface](airframe-surface.md) 
  - Object shape inspector. What parameters are defined in an object? 
- [airframe-spec](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/blob/master/spec/shared/src/main/scala/wvlet/airframe/AirframeSpec.scala) 
  - A simple base trait for using ScalaTest.

# Getting Started

[![Latest version](https://index.scala-lang.org/wvlet/airframe/airframe/latest.svg?color=orange)](https://index.scala-lang.org/wvlet/airframe)

**build.sbt**
```
libraryDependencies += "org.wvlet" %% "airframe" % "(version)"

# For Scala.js (supported since airframe 0.12)
libraryDependencies += "org.wvlet" %%% "airframe" % "(version)"
```

## Usage
Airframe can be used in three steps:

### Bind
Inject necessary classes with `bind[X]`:

```scala
import wvlet.airframe._

trait App {
  val x = bind[X]
  val y = bind[Y]
  val z = bind[Z]
  // Do something with X, Y, and Z
}
```
### Design
Describe how to provide object instances:

```scala
val design : Design =
   newDesign
     .bind[X].toInstance(new X)  // Bind type X to a concrete instance
     .bind[Y].toSingleton        // Bind type Y to a singleton object
     .bind[Z].to[ZImpl]          // Bind type Z to an instance of ZImpl

// Note that *Design* is *immutable*, so you can safely reuse and extend it by adding more bindings.     
```

### Build
Create a concrete instance:

```scala
val session = design.newSession
val app : App = session.build[App]
```

Airframe builds an instance of `App` based on the binding rules specified in the *Design* object.
`Session` manages the lifecycle of objects generated by Airframe. For example, singleton objects that are instantiated within a Session will be discarded when `Session.shutdown` is called.
